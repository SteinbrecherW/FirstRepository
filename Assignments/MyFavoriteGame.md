# My Favorite Game

## An Obligatory Ramble About *Dark Souls*
---
I love *Dark Souls*. You love *Dark Souls*. everybody loves **Dark Souls**. Anybody who doesn't like ***Dark Souls*** either hasn't played it or hasn't played it enough.  Do I even need to explain myself? It's a perfect game. 

What makes this game the best game? That's the kind of question that somebody who hasn't played ***DARK SOULS*** would ask, to which my response would be as follows:

>Play *Dark Souls*.
>>Seriously.
>>>***Play it***.

Graphics. Gameplay. Storytelling. Music. These are literally all of the aspects of games, and they are all perfect in *Dark Souls*. So the game is perfect. 

    No further questions.
